				<p>Victor Santiago has an AAS in Computer Networking Systems and a B.S. in Information Systems and Cyber Security with over ten years of experience in the field of Information Technology. I have worked as a System Administrator, Windows Network Technician, for multiple MSP assisting other businesses with their technical challenges and IT operations.</p>
                <p>I am a very active person, positive, never give up on anything, critical thinker and passionate about technology. I taught myself Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Databases since 2008. Learning on my own have been a journey and adding all the experience I gathered while on college, real work experience, with many hands-on projects, I am very confident I can be a great asset for your organisation. You might ask yourself why I did not go to College for Development instead? Great Question, I did not have proper advice back then, and ITT Tech was not offering development at that time. I did not want to waste any more time as I was 27 years old already, so I went for Information Security instead. I never stopped there, so I never finished learning how to code, and I have not stopped yet. Learning to code is my most significant award, however.</p>
